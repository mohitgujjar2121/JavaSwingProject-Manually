# JavaSwingProject-Manually
This is Java Swing Given to us by our teacher, in this we are using password as current date, after successful login, there is an option to select company and year , 
after successful selection , all the records belong to that company and year appear on screen , on selecting a user from list, 
we can see the overall information about that specific user.
i have named it manually because i haven't used any drag and drop facility available in ide (NetBeans).

SOFTWARES USED : Appache NetBeans 12.2 , Derby 10.0.1 .
